|   6       |   Facade                      |   It offers a simple interface to more complex underlying objects                                  |
|   7       |   Adapter                     |   It provides us for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes                                                     |
|   8       |   Composite                   |   It wraps a group of objects into a single object                                               |
|   9       |   Proxy                       |   It reduces the cost, reduce complexity, and provide the placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access                                                      |
|   10      |   Bridge                      |   It decouples an abstraction so that two classes can vary independently                          |
|   11      |   Decorator                   |   It extends the object behavior dynamically at the run time                                 |
|   12      |   Flyweight                   |   It decreases the cost of complex object model                                                |

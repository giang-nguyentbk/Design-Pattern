|   NO      |   Name                        |   Usage       |
|   :---:   |   :---                        |   :---        |
|   6       |   [Facade](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Structural/Facade)                      |   It offers a simple interface to more complex underlying objects                                  |
|   7       |   [Adapter](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Structural/Adapter)                     |   It provides us for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes                                                     |
|   8       |   [Composite](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Structural/Composite)                   |   It wraps a group of objects into a single object                                               |
|   9       |   [Proxy](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Structural/Proxy)                       |   It reduces the cost, reduce complexity, and provide the placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access                                                      |
|   10      |   [Bridge](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Structural/Bridge)                      |   It decouples an abstraction so that two classes can vary independently                          |
|   11      |   [Decorator](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Structural/Decorator)                   |   It extends the object behavior dynamically at the run time                                 |
|   12      |   [Flyweight](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Structural/Flyweight)                   |   It decreases the cost of complex object model                                                |

|   13      |   [Interator](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Interator)                   |   It accesses all the element of an object sequentially without violating its underlying representation                                              |
|   14      |   [Observer](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Observer)                    |   It allows a number of observer objects to see an event                                     |
|   15      |   [Command](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Command)                     |   It generates the objects which encapsulate actions of parameters                           |
|   16      |   [Strategy](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Strategy)                    |   It provides one of the families of algorithm to be selected at the runtime                     |
|   17      |   [State](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/State)                       |   It allows an object to modify its behavior when it's internal states changes                  |
|   18      |   [Template Method](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Template-Method)             |   It allows the subclasses to provide concrete behavior. It also defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class                                                       |
|   19      |   [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Chain-Of-Responsibility)     |   It representatives the command to a chain of processing object                                  |
|   20      |   [Mediator](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Mediator)                    |   It provides the loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their existing methods                                            |
|   21      |   [Interpreter](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Interpreter)                 |   It implements a specialized language                                                    |
|   22      |   [Memento](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Memento)                     |   It restores an object in the previous state                                              |
|   23      |   [Visitor](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Behavioral/Visitor)                     |   It separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object                                                      |

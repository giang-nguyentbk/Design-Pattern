|   1       |   [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Creational/Abstract-Factory)            |   It allows us to create objects without specifying their concrete type                      |
|   2       |   [Factory Method](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Creational/Factory-Method)              |   It allows us to create object without specifying the exact class to create                |
|   3       |   [Singleton](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Creational/Singleton)                   |   It makes sure that there is only one instance of an object is created                            |

|   5       |   [Builder](https://github.com/giang-nguyentbk/Design-Pattern/tree/main/Creational/Builder)                     |   It is used to create the complex objects                                                     |
